# Camera Viewport Rect
Automatically setup `Camera` viewports from `RectTransform`s.

This way one can easily show 3D models directly into responsive UI without the need of setting up `RenderTexture`s.


## Features
- Supports canvases in both `Screen Space - Overlay` and `Screen Space - Camera` modes
- Supports enabling/disabling the target Camera when the script itself gets enabled/disabled
